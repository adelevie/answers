    party **on you own property** (whether it's inside or outside, whether you rent
    or own) you don't need a permit to play amplified music or serve alcohol. ----------
    **Times when you WILL need an event permit** There are times when you will need
    a **special permit** to hold an event. Conditions that require a special event
    permit include: - an event that is open to the public with 50 or more people will
    be in attendance - events that require street closures (e.g. a block party) -
    a party where people will be drinking alcohol outside of private property - a
    party with amplified sound that can be heard beyond your own property ----------
    **How to get the permits you need** If you think your party meets the qualifications
    above then you will need **at least one permit from the City, maybe more.** Almost
    **all** events require a permit from the Special Activities unit of the City Administrator's
    Office. In most (not all) cases, you are going to need to prove that you have
    liability insurance for your proposed event. You can apply for a permit by contacting
    either of the following staff people: - Nancy Marcus - 510-238-3294 - nmarcus@oaklandnet.com
    - Jasmine Chan - 510-238-6914 - jchan@oaklandnet.com If your party is going to
    require a **street closure** then you must you must file an application with the
    Special Event Unit of the Oakland Police Department. Be sure to file the application
    with OPD **at least 30 days prior to your event**. To hold a party in a public
    space (e.g. a City park) you will need to request a reservation with the Office
    of Parks and Recreation by phone at 510-238-3187 or by email at oprscheduling@oaklandnet.com. "

  content_main: Yes, you can apply for any City job that is open and apply for as
    many of them as you like at the same time. But for each position, you have to
    fill out separate applications since each job posting usually requires information
    unique to that job – it might be special questions, or you’ll have to attach a
    copy of a certificate, that sort of thing.
  content_main_extra: 'Let''s say you''ve applied to a job before at the [Employment
    Opportunities][1] page. High five. Your standard information is are all saved
    with your account in your online profile. Address, past work history, all the
    stock info is saved. You can use the stored information for your new job with
    a click of a button and update it as you need to. **However, most jobs have Supplemental
    Questions that you MUST answer.** These questions are specific and unique. For
    instance, if I apply for a Park Ranger job and a Park Supervisor job, my resume
    is going to look pretty much the same and I can use it for both. But the questions
    asked by the applications for the two jobs are different, so I need to answer
    those questions differently. [1]: http://agency.governmentjobs.com/oaklandca/default.cfm'

  content_need_to_know: 'You can file an "Interest Notification" for multiple jobs

  content_main: "**Verify that you are legally allowed to evict the tenant.** ◦ A
    tenant may be evicted for failing to pay rent. ◦  A tenant may be evicted for
    violating the lease. ◦  A tenant may be evicted for using the rental unit for
    an unlawful purpose. ◦  A tenant may be evicted for manufacturing or dealing illegal
    drugs in the rental unit. ◦  A tenant may be evicted for the unlawful use of a
    weapon or ammunition. ◦ A tenant may be evicted for materially damaging the rental
    unit. ◦  A tenant may be evicted for causing a significant nuisance to other tenants.
    **Serve the tenant with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit form.** ◦ Take the
    completed form to the tenant and hand it to him or her. If he or she refuses to
    take it, leave it on the ground near the tenant. ◦ If you are unable to serve
    it directly to the tenant, leave it with someone who is at least 18 years old
    at the rental unit or with an adult at the tenant's place of work. A copy must
    also be mailed to the tenant in this situation. ◦ If unable to serve the form
    directly to another person, post it on the tenant's door and mail a copy of the
    form to him or her. **Allow the tenant 3 business days (Monday to Friday) after
    delivering the notice to remedy the situation.** ◦  The 3-day period begins the
    day after the notice is served. **File an Unlawful Detainer Complaint, a Civil
    Case Cover Sheet, and a Pre-judgment Right of Possession form.** ◦ The Unlawful
    Detainer Complaint can be found at the following URL: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ud100.pdf.
    This is an eviction notice. ◦  The Civil Case Cover Sheet can be found at the
    following URL: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cm010.pdf ◦  Submit the paperwork
    to the courthouse in the county that the property is in. ◦ The County Clerk will
    give you a Summons and a stamped copy of the Unlawful Detainer Complaint. Make
    sure you also receive the Pre-judgment Right of Possession form. In some cases,
    you must provide multiple copies for the Clerk to stamp. **Serve the tenant with
    the Unlawful Detainer Complaint, the Summons, and the Pre-judgment Right of Possession
    form.** ◦  Serve these in the same way as you served the 3-day Notice to Pay Rent
    or Quit form. ◦  The tenant will have 5 days to file a response with you and the
    court. Post and mail the tenant has 10 days to respond, after the 10 days start
    counting the 5 days, if no response file for judgement. **Complete the court process.**
    ◦ If the tenant does not answer within 5 days after being served, request a default
    judgment from the court. This can be done by submitting a following form to the
    court. ◦  If a default judgment is issued, you will be given a Writ of Possession.
    Take this form to the local Sheriff and have him or her evict the tenant. ◦  If
    the tenant decides to challenge the eviction, you or the tenant may request a
    trial in front of a judge or jury. The trial will occur within 21 days of the
    request. ◦ If you win the case, you will be awarded possession of the property
    and possibly monetary awards. ◦ If you win the case, the court will order the
    Sheriff to post a notice giving the tenant 5 days to vacate the rental unit. If
    the tenant does not leave, the Sheriff will forcibly remove him or her. ◦ If the
    tenant wins the case, he or she will be permitted to remain in the rental unit.
    You may have to pay his or her court fees and he or she may be ordered to pay
    any past-due rent. **Store the tenant's items for 2 weeks if he or she is evicted.**
    ◦ If the tenant leaves items behind, you must store them for 2 weeks and attempt
    to arrange for the tenant to retrieve them. ◦  If anything remains after this
    period, you may keep, sell, or dispose of the items. More info: http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/index.shtml
