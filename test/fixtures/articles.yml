    In general, an applicant must show that he or she has been and continues to be a person of GMC during the statutory period prior to filing and up to the time of the Oath of Allegiance.

    The applicable naturalization provision under which the applicant files determines the period during which the applicant must demonstrate GMC.  The applicant’s conduct outside the GMC period may also impact whether he or she meets the GMC requirement.

    While USCIS determines whether an applicant has met the GMC requirement on a case-by-case basis, certain types of criminal conduct automatically preclude applicants from establishing GMC and may make the applicant subject to removal proceedings.[5] An applicant may also be found to lack GMC for other types of criminal conduct (or unlawful acts).
